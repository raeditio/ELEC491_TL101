<img width="800" height="600" alt="drone" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeb8d346-e71f-4aec-9329-7cb6d21e3310" />

## Overview
This repository contains the code and configurations for a **custom-built autonomous drone navigation system** using **VINS-Fusion** for visual–inertial SLAM and **FUEL** for frontier-based path planning.  
Developed as part of a capstone project at the University of British Columbia, the system was designed to replicate an **unmanned HVAC inspection drone** on a smaller, custom-built base frame.  
The platform operates in GPS-denied environments by leveraging ROS-based remote computation over a LAN.

> **Note:** An experimental branch using **ORB-SLAM3** is available on the `orbslam3` branch.  
> This version replaces the D435i depth feed with a **monocular RGB camera**.  
> The RGB images are processed using **Depth-Anything-V2** to generate depth maps,  
> which are then combined with the original RGB frames and fed into ORB-SLAM3 in RGB-D mode.

## Hardware Framework
The drone is a **custom frame** equipped with:
- **Battery**
- **PX4-compatible flight controller**
- **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)**
- **Brushless motors**
- **Onboard IMU**
- **Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB)**
- **Intel RealSense D435i** (RGB-D camera with IMU)
- **Additional RGB-D camera** (optional)

## System Data Flow
1. **Onboard Processing (Raspberry Pi 4)**  
   - Runs **ROS Master**.  
   - Publishes IMU and D435i RGB-D data over LAN via **remote ROS**.

2. **Offboard Processing (Client Computer)**  
   - Subscribes to data from Raspberry Pi.  
   - Runs **VINS-Fusion** to perform visual–inertial SLAM and estimate pose.  
   - Combines pose with depth data from D435i and sends it into **FUEL**.  
   - **FUEL** executes frontier-based path planning and outputs navigation commands.

3. **Command Feedback Loop**  
   - FUEL’s output is sent back to the Raspberry Pi via ROS.  
   - **MAVROS** converts navigation commands into PX4 flight controller commands.  
   - PX4 adjusts motor outputs through ESCs to achieve autonomous movement.

## Key Features
- **SLAM Core:** VINS-Fusion for tightly coupled visual–inertial odometry.
- **Autonomous Exploration:** FUEL frontier-based path planning for exploring unknown spaces.
- **Remote ROS Networking:** Offloads SLAM and planning to a more powerful ground computer.
- **PX4 Integration:** MAVROS-based control of flight operations.
- **Custom Drone Frame:** Tailored to replicate HVAC inspection drone operation on a smaller scale.
